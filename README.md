 Simple Login Form with Validation:
                                  This is a beginner-friendly Login Form web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                                  It provides a clean interface for users to enter their email and password and includes basic form validation for a better user experience.

How It Works?
              User enters an email and password.
              JavaScript checks if both fields are filled:
                                  Email must be valid.
                                  Password must be at least 6 characters.
              If valid, a success alert appears. Otherwise, error messages are displayed.
